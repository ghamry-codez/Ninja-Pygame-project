# Ninja-Pygame-project
This is a game created in python with 3 levels, where you are a ninja that can run, dash, jump and wall jump while fighting enemies. This is not fully complete and there will be more levels to come, any feedback is appreciated!

YOU MUST RUN THE FOLDER "Ninja Game" IN WHATEVER SOFTWARE YOU ARE USING FOR THE GAME TO WORK
controls:

up arrow = jump 

left and right arrows = move left and right accordingly 

x = dash

Objective: 
kill all enemies to advance to the next level. Enemies have guns that shoot pellets, only 1 pellet is sufficient to kill you. Beware, sliding on a wall for too long will result in death.
